# File-Reader-Writer
This program is designed to teach reading and writing to a sequential file. The program 
first asks the user for the name of both the input and output file. 
It utilizes one file to read in individual lines of text.
The program then edits each line of text by adding line numbers
to the beginning of each line. It then writes each line of text to the output file.
