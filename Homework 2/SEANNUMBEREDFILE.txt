4: then number them line by line.
 
5: This can be very useful
 
6: in certain applications
 
7: such as homework
 
8: this kind of stuff is very interesting
 
9: but ultimately is probably only a building block
 
10: for more useful forms of storage such as binary
 
11: but it is important to know none-the-less
