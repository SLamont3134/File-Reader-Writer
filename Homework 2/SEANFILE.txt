This is a simple program
I will demonstrate how to take lines of text
directly out of a file
then number them line by line.
This can be very useful
in certain applications
such as homework
this kind of stuff is very interesting
but ultimately is probably only a building block
for more useful forms of storage such as binary
but it is important to know none-the-less
